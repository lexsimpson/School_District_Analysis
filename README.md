# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to get updated numbers during a school district analysis due to administrators finding evidence of altered 9th grade scores. We replaced the 9th grade scores with NaNs and reviewed the results.

## Results

There was not much change in this analysis before and after. The biggest change was the overall passing percent.
